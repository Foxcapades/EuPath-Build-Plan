== Goals

1. Modernize our build process
2. Break apart the monolith build
3. Simplify/Unify our build scripts
4. Separate build from deployment
5. Separate build from version control


== Increments


=== Part 1: Maven to Gradle

Exchange the maven pom files for <<gradle,Gradle>> builds.  Parts of
the Ant build that call to maven will now call to Gradle.

Gradle projects will declare their project dependencies and
the build should function similarly to the previous build
system.

The base-pom file will be converted to a Gradle <<javaPlat,
`java-platform`>> Bill of Materials.

Boilerplate details, such as developer information or custom
<<artRep,Artifact Repositories>> will be extracted to a
Gradle plugin which can be published to a Maven repository.

This conversion is almost 1 to 1 and wil be tedious, but
should not be not difficult.  This particular change should
only affect users in that the log output will be different.

At this point in time the Gradle distribution will follow
the standard practice of including a base version in the
source repository.

{searchMaven}[All references to Maven] will need to be
removed or updated at this time.


==== Impact on Servers

None as <<gradle,Gradle>> will be included with the source code.

For developer convenience (potentially faster builds) it may
be nice to have Gradle installed on the development servers,
but this is not required.

WARNING: TODO: get a list of all non-project scripts that
  call Maven directly


==== Impact on Jenkins

None at this point, the Jenkins `rebuilder` script will call
Ant as normal.

==== Impact on Developers

Different looking log output during build.

Potentially faster project build times.


=== Part 2: Ant to Gradle

Convert the build XML declarations into <<gradle,Gradle>> actions.

At this point, custom scripts will be left alone, calls to
them will be maintained, and converted to calls from Gradle.

Most Ant actions or behaviors are available easily in Gradle
or can be easily recreated as a function in Gradle.  Any Ant
functions we rely on which have no built-in mirror in Gradle
will be made into a plugin which will be published to our
internal Maven repository to be made available to all
projects.

{searchAnt}[All references to Ant] will need to be replaced
or updated at this point.


==== Impact on Servers

The `rebuilder` script will be updated to call Gradle rather
than Ant.

WARNING: TODO: get a list of all non-project scripts that
  call ant directly.


==== Impact on Jenkins

The Jenkins `rebuilder` script will be updated to call
Gradle rather than Ant.

==== Impact on Developers

Any Ant calls will now be made through Gradle.


=== Part 3: Scripts to Gradle

Convert the custom wrapper and helper scripts into <<gradle,
Gradle>> actions.

This will mean custom (Java) code will need to be written.
This code will be created as a Gradle plugin and published
to our internal Maven server so as to be made available to
all project builds.

WARNING: TODO: Get a list of all project wrapper scripts

WARNING: TODO: Get a list of all project calls to those
  wrapper scripts


==== Impact on Servers

WARNING: TODO: Get a list of all non-project wrapper scripts

WARNING: TODO: Get a list of all non-project calls to both
  project and non-project wrapper scripts


==== Impact on Jenkins

WARNING: TODO: figure this out!


==== Impact on Developers


WARNING: Find out what scripts users actually call anymore
  many may be stripped out entirely.


Scripts that users call will be converted to gradle actions.


=== Part 4: Split the monolith

Take each project's <<gradle,Gradle>> build and convert its
dependency on sibling projects into artifact dependencies
with <<#condSubst,Conditional Substitution>>.

.Early phase Gradle dependency
[source, groovy]
----
// Require local projects
dependencies {
  compile project(':FgpUtil.Util')
  compile project(':WDK.Model')
  compile project(':WDK.Service')
  ...
}
----

.Late phase Gradle dependency def
[source, groovy]
----
// Use local project if available
configurations.all {
  dependencies.compile { ->
    if it.location.exists {
      substitute module(it.name) with project("${it.group}.${it.name}")
    }
  }
}

// Otherwise default to compiled jar
dependencies {
  compile 'org.gusdb.FgpUtil:Util'
  compile 'org.gusdb.WDK:Model'
  compile 'org.gusdb.WDK:Service'
  ...
}
----


=== Part 5: Deployments

Using a Gradle task on the root projects themselves, a
separate 'deploy' project, or some other tool if we are okay
with duplicating our dependency list, we can build a tar or
tars that bundle the required components for a site. Jenkins
can then copy the tar(s) to the desired location and run any
existing post build steps (such as WDKCache).

[WARNING]
TODO: +
How will conifer fit into this? +
can it be moved to a post step? +
how much work would that be?



== Issues / Concerns


=== Bundling of non-java project code

With <<gradle,Gradle>>'s customizable nature, additional
compile tasks can be added for non-Java source code.

In CI additional steps can be performed to publish those
components as bundles or packages as per the standard
practices for the specific language.

In early phases of the build update, non-Java dependencies
will be treated as they are in the current build process.

When we migrate towards a separate build/deploy strategy
we will need to have a system in place to host, version, and
update these dependencies.

Dependencies that do not have a package manager may be
bundled as a OS package for yum or apt, or alternatively
these may just be pulled at deploy time by the deployment
script.

==== Possible approaches by language


===== Perl

With Perl we have a couple of options available to us.  We
can use a private CPAN repository, or alternatively, we can
split the Perl code into separate git repositories and
depend on it {cpanGitUse}[via git itself].


====== Versioning

Depending on the package hosting approach above we may use
different strategies, using git we can use git tags to
maintain releases or different versions.  Using a private
CPAN repository, we would need to come up with a concrete
versioning strategy.


===== JavaScript/TypeScript

This is already handled for us via NPM or Yarn.  Similarly
to Perl, we may desire to host our JavaScript & TypeScript
code in a private NPM repository, or split that code out and
just use git.

=== Artifact Versioning

WARNING: Everything about this needs to be discussed.  The
  below sections outline a rough idea that may work for our
  team.


==== Releases

For releases, artifacts will be built using the version
format `<siteRelease>.<artifactBuild>` or, for example
`46.0`.  The java platform project will be updated to
reflect the concrete versions of the artifacts that will be
used for a site release.

The `<artifactBuild>` will be the number of builds of the
release artifact for a site version, so as live patches are
added, this number will increment.

.Example Release History
[source]
----
WDK:
  48.0 - Site Release
  48.1 - Memory leak fix
  49.0 - Site Release
  49.1 - Corrected typo
  49.2 - Fix for user-comment search
----


==== Development

While in development artifacts will be versioned using the
format `<nextRelease>.SNAPSHOT-<artifactBuildNumber>`.

The `<artifactBuildNumber>` (and potentially `<nextRelease>`)
params will be managed by CI to avoid conflicts.

The development <<javaPlat,Java Platform>> will be given a
wildcard version identifier that simply specifies that
builds should use the latest artifact.

.Example Version History
[source]
----
WDK:
  46.SNAPSHOT-105: Added public user datasets to user dataset list
  46.SNAPSHOT-106: Corrected issue with deleted public user datasets
--- Site Build 47 released---
  47.SNAPSHOT-1: Added user id field to service endpoint result
  47.SNAPSHOT-2: Reworked question service
----


=== Multi-project development workflow

Initially the projects will declare each other as local
dependencies which will mean that components will be rebuilt
as needed in a manner similar to the previous builds.

Eventually dependencies will be handled with conditional
substitutions, a built in Gradle feature, which will use a
local project when available instead of the Maven repository
version of that dependency.


== Questions

* Depending on different language dependencies?
** These are runtime dependencies and the bundling of the
   deployable package will be managed by the deployment
   script.
+
Perhaps this means we should split repositories in git along
language lines?

* How will conifer fit into this world of separate projects?

* Factoring builds?

* Division of deployments?

* Triggers for builds?  (build cascade when a dependency)
** Does conditional substitution trigger child project builds?


== Definitions


[#artRep]
=== Artifact Repository

An Artifact Repository is a server or system designed to
provide hosting and versioning for bundled packages of code
or resources for distribution or linking as complete
applications or libraries.

Most widely used languages have one or more commonly used
Package Managers which will generally use an Artifact
Repository, or Source Repository when retrieving or
installing applications or dependencies.


[#condSubst]
=== Conditional Substitution

A Gradle feature that enables the substitution of one
dependency with another if some condition is met.

In our case this would likely mean using a sibling project
instead of an artifact if that project exists in your
workspace.

See {condSubstBlog}[this blog post], or {condSubstDocs}[the
Gradle docs] for a more detailed explanation.


[#gradle]
=== Gradle

Gradle is a build and dependency management and scripting
tool specifically designed around working with JVM
languages.

Gradle's functionality covers the use cases for both Ant and
Maven, and is easily extensible to include our custom build
tasks.

See {gradleDocs}[the Gradle user manual] for more
information.


[#javaPlat]
=== Java Platform

The <<gradle,Gradle>> method of creating a Bill of Materials
for a project or group of projects.

The Java Platform can be used to define and/or constrain
projects to a known working set of dependencies.  Similar to
our base-pom files, our dependency versions can be declared
here and omitted from individual project dependency
declarations.

See {javaPlatDocs}[the Gradle docs] for more information.
